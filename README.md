# Quantum-Cube

Under development, not for production.

Quantum simulation of symbolic linguistics.

A single literal is added to a quantum cube, which creates a new cube with four faces and three models that will seed the two faces out of a matrice of many literals into four symbolic matrices. An RNG is then used to make a decision based upon chance pulling out a literal and fed back into the cube, which then creates a literal that has a symbolic answer. Finally, a RNG makes the definite choiche produced by the cube. The other answers are then fed back into the cube, plus the final answer and reseeded as a symbolic instead of a literal, thus becomes a face on one of the matrice, which then reiterates and is joined in a finite set as our array. The array given back is then the symbolic linguistic pattern and outcome.
