# Quantum-Cube

Under development, not for production.

Quantum simulation of symbolic linguistics.

A single literal is added to the quantum cube, which creates a cube with four faces and three models that will seed two faces with literals into four symbolic matrices. An RNG is then used to make a decision based upon chance pulling out a literal and fed back into the cube, which then creates a literal symbolic answer.
