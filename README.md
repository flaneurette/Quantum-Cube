# Quantum-Cube

Under development, not for production.

Quantum simulation of symbolic linguistics.

A single literal is added to a quantum cube, which creates a new cube with four faces and three models that will seed the two faces out of a matrice of many literals into four symbolic matrices. An RNG is then used to make a decision based upon chance pulling out a literal and fed back into the cube, which then creates a literal that has a symbolic answer. Finally, a RNG makes the definite choiche produced by the cube. The other answers are then fed back into the cube, plus the final answer and reseeded as a symbolic instead of a literal, thus becomes a face on one of the matrice, which then reiterates and is joined in a finite set as our array. The array given back is then the symbolic linguistic pattern and outcome that has at least 4, to 64 states from a single literal. Each symbolic literal in our final array also has 64 states which can be referenced back to each state within in the final matrice by tracing each face of the matrice with any literal out of the final array, thus any symbolic literal has a double symbolic literal within each set. This then, can be iterated over and any literal will then have a similar symbolic outcome that will complement the final array.
